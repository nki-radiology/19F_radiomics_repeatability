This repository contains the analysis notebooks and lightweight helper code used for our study:

**“19F MRI radiomic features: in vitro and in vivo”** (European Radiology Experimental).

## What is in this repository

- `notebooks/`: the analysis notebooks.
- `data/`: **no real data** is distributed. Contains a README describing the input file formats.

## Data availability
This repository does not include imaging data, segmentations, or any patient-level data.  
You will need to provide your own data in the expected format (see `data/README.md`).
